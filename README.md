# Modeling-Urinal-Choice-Behavior

Our observational study aims to quantitatively characterize the male behavior in bathrooms that guide their choice of urinals and provides a perceptual basis for this phenomenon. Participants in each configuration of urinals were recorded in multiple groups by order in which they chose their urinals. These observations were recorded using disguised participant observation where a team member pretended to text near the entrance while plugging data into a spreadsheet. We then simulated the collected data on different models that resemble possible decision strategies and were then evaluated against the observed set. Our study discusses different metrics that can be associated to a configuration of urinals which can be used to compare and design restrooms/public spaces with cognitive considerations of personal space in a holistic approach to understand the system.
